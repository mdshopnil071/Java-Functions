Java Functions Examples 
A comprehensive collection of Java function examples to help beginners understand the concept of methods/functions in Java programming.
📖 What are Functions in Java?
Functions (also called methods in Java) are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in:

Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times
Modularity: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
Organization: Keep code clean and structured
Maintainability: Easy to debug and modify

🔧 Function Syntax: 
public static returnType functionName(parameters) {
    // function body
    return value; // if returnType is not void
}

 Learning Path
Start with: Basic Addition (SumExample.java)
Then try: Product Example (ProductExample.java)
Advanced: Binomial Coefficient (BinomialCoefficient.java)
Master: Function Overloading (FunctionOverloading.java)

 Benefits of Using Functions

✅ Reusability: Write once, use everywhere
✅ Readability: Code is easier to understand
✅ Debugging: Easier to find and fix errors
✅ Testing: Test individual functions separately
✅ Maintenance: Modify code in one place
